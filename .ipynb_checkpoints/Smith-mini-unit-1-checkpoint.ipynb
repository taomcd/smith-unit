I know that what you want is a definite answer, a ‘right way’ to do your research…. and you want those things right now! But rushing ahead without considering some of the implications of your choices could actually slow down your research progress, and might even lead to some bad outcomes with research that is irreproducible or, worse, has problems or deficiencies.*\n",

As you can see, rigorous science means more than care or exactness in conducting your experiment. It also includes sound statistical analysis, avoiding bias in your data interpretation and reporting, and acknowledging the limitations of your research. Knowing how to identify areas for improvement in your research process is critical for a successful career in science.*"

These are meant to be positively framed to help learners understand why a focus on research questions can be important in the long-run.
