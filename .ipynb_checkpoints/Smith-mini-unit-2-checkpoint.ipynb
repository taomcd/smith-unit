    "Crafting a rigorous research question can be intimidating regardless of whether you are a student or an experienced researcher. A good way to get started is to utilize an outline or framework to guide your development. There are many different frameworks available to help you identify the elements needed to craft a rigorous research question. Which framework you choose may be dependent on your field, your specific research question, or simply your personal intuitive preference. This mini-unit will provide an overview of commonly used frameworks in the biomedical sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, the table below provides an overview of the different frameworks of focus in this mini-unit. You’ll note that among commonly used frameworks, there is a fair degree of overlap among domains. Every research project is unique and different elements may or may not be relevant to a given initiative. That being said, these frameworks serve to assist researchers by helping them think through whether a given domain is relevant to their work, and whether it needs to be clearly defined as a part of the planning process."
