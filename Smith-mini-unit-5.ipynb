    ">__Narrator__: When you have the data, you’re ready to think about the next step: convincing someone else that you have a possible solution to your research problem. But how do you make a persuasive argument about your data? \n",
    ">\n",
    ">Let’s look at the elements of making a good argument:\n",
    ">1. Stating your claim\n",
    ">2. Providing reasons to support your claim\n",
    "Example: ”Drug X affects neurogenesis (claim) because drug X increases number of neurons counted in the hippocampus (reason)”\n",
    ">\n",
    ">3. Providing evidence to support those reasons\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Example: Evidence = raw data, patterns illustrated in graphs, proper statistics.  Something that will make the reader believe that drug X affects neuron number, and that there are more neurons after drug x treatment than before. “Evidence is something your readers can see, touch, taste, smell or hear”\n",
    ">\n",
    ">4. Do you acknowledge limitations/complications/alternative interpretations, and how do you respond? We need to think hard about sources of bias and how to be transparent about data that don’t fit with our claims.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">__Narrator__: Making an effective argument might seem like a difficult task. However, as people, we are making arguments all the time when in conversation with others. Take the following example:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">>__Speaker A__: [poses a problem, framed as a question]\n",
    ">>\n",
    ">>__Speaker B__: [makes a claim that answers the question]\n",
    ">>\n",
    ">>__A__: Why is that? [asks for a reason to believe B’s claim]\n",
    ">>\n",
    ">>__B__: [offers a reason]\n",
    ">>\n",
    ">>__A__: [doesn’t see how B’s reason is relevant to his claim]\n",
    ">>\n",
    ">>__B__: [offers evidence to back up reason]\n",
    ">>\n",
    ">>__A__: [offers a point that contradicts B’s reason]\n",
    ">>\n",
    ">>__B__: [acknowledges A’s objection and responds to it]\n",
    ">>\n",
    ">>__A__: [asks about the limits of B’s claim]\n",
    ">>\n",
    ">>__B__: [limits the scope of his claim and adds a condition]\n",
