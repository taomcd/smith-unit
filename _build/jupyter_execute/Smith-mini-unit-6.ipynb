    "__Overview__: When you modify your thinking, you can either modify the next question to ask, the hypothesis to test or the model.  You need to consider the limitations of your results. Being open to alternative interpretations is important for rigorous research. It’s important to understand how prior decisions influence how much impact your results will have."

But if it didn’t seem to work at all, you don’t want to simply repeat it. Try to clarify what you what to know next and how your next experiment will move you forward.\n",
